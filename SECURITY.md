## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **Private Message**: Contact the project maintainers directly
3. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Affected versions, operating systems, browsers
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on complexity, typically within 30 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate the reported vulnerability
3. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
4. **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue
5. **Credit**: We will credit you for the discovery (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- Keep your system updated with the latest patches
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review your account activity
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### For Developers

- Follow secure coding practices
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper input validation
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper session management
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Common Security Issues

### SQL Injection Prevention

```java
// Good: Use PreparedStatement
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
stmt.setString(1, username);
stmt.setString(2, password);

// Bad: String concatenation
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
```

### XSS Prevention

```java
// Good: Escape output
String safeOutput = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(userInput);

// Bad: Direct output
out.println(userInput);
```

### Session Security

```java
// Good: Secure session configuration
session.setMaxInactiveInterval(1800); // 30 minutes
// Use secure cookies
// Implement proper logout
```

1. **Immediate Response**: Assess and contain the incident
2. **Investigation**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Communication**: Notify affected users
4. **Remediation**: Fix the vulnerability
5. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures
